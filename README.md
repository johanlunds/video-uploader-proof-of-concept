## General flow:

1. post /videos/uploads.
  * should be authenticated
  * create row in db
2. return S3 info + db id
3. upload video to bucket #1
4. post db id + other info to post /videos
  * set state = processing
5. on S3 upload finished post to SNS topic (that does PUT /videos/uploads/:id)
6. create job in Elastic Transcoder
7. move results + original to bucket #2
8. post to SNS when Elastic Transcoder finished (that does PUT /videos/upload/:id)
9. set state = processed
10. show response + video in Client.

## Docker

### Locally

```
docker-compose up
docker-compose run server rake db:create
open http://localhost:3000

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d
```

### Remotely on EC2

```
docker-machine create --amazonec2-region us-west-2 --driver amazonec2 --amazonec2-vpc-id $VPC_ID --amazonec2-subnet-id $SUBNET_ID --amazonec2-zone c  video-uploads-docker-test
eval $(docker-machine env video-uploads-docker-test)

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

Re-deploy after changes:

```
docker-compose build client client_assets
docker-compose up --no-deps -d client client_assets
```


## How to get SNS notifications to work when running locally:

```
./ngrok http 4000
```

Set up SNS to POST to:

```
http://3e253438.ngrok.io/video_uploads/sns_notifications
```


## Todos/improvements

* [ ] mount Sqlite3 volume or switch to Postgres
  * Currently `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml exec server bundle exec rake db:setup`
* [ ] Build a mobile app as client
* [ ] try out Gitlab Docker CI/CD
* [ ] try out CoreOS/Kubernetes/Mesos
  * http://blog.cloud66.com/9-crtitical-decisions-needed-to-run-docker-in-production/
* [ ] replace alert-dialogs in VideoController with UI
* [ ] Known issue: application.js/application.css are not loaded correctly sometimes. Probably a race condition when starting the services in Docker
* [ ] TODOs in code for improvements and proper error handling for a real production app:
